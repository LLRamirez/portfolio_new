# The Water Fight of ALL WATER FIGHTS

---

<br/>
Songkran is Thailand's new year festival that's celebrated with a water fight. Yes, you read that right - a water fight!

<br/>

In Thailand it's believed that splashing water on each other during Songkran brings good luck, washes away bad luck, and cleanses the body and mind. It also happens to be a great way to cool off in the scorching April heat.
<br/>
The festival is celebrated across Thailand, but the biggest celebrations take place in Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Tourists flock to Thailand during this time to join in the fun and get drenched in water.
<br/>
But be warned, no one is safe during Songkran. People arm themselves with water guns, buckets, hoses, and even elephants. You could be walking down the street minding your own business, and suddenly, someone will douse you with a bucket of water. It's all in good fun, though, and you'll soon find yourself laughing along with everyone else.
<br/>
The festival also has a more traditional side to it. Thais visit temples to make merit, pay respect to their ancestors, and seek blessings from monks. They also perform a ritual known as "rod nam dam hua," where they pour water over the hands of elders to show respect and seek their blessings.
<br/>
If you're planning to visit Thailand during Songkran, make sure you come prepared to get wet! Don't forget to join in the fun - it's an experience you'll never forget. <3
